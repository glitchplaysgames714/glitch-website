<li>Various settings configured by an individual user or the server, such as player policies or spawn silent option</li>
</ul>
<p>The bot has access to the content of messages but is used solely for the purpose of anti-cheat and the said content is not stored longer than necessary for the analysis (under one second). Message content is never cached or stored, and cannot be accessed by the administrators to read your messages.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-data-is-stored">How the data is stored</h2>
<p>All persistent data is stored on a PostgreSQL server, running on a server hosted localy on the servers.</p>
